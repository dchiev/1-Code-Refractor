# 1-Code-Refractor
This assignment's objective was to refractor an already working index and css file. 

# My Process
1. Use semantic elements. The previous elements already provided a semantic outline, BUT used classes to define them. For example, the footer used "class=footer". There, I just swapped it out for the semantic element of footer.

2. Images were missing alt text. This would have a negative effect on SEO and accessbiltiy. I added alt text to each image. 

3. For the styling sheet, there were redundancies. For example, many of the elements were able to be placed under a single group of styling. So I removed some of the redundancies, placed as many as the corresponding elements under each group, and tested the file. I continued this for as many elements possible. 

# Takeaways

From this assignment, I realized you can make your index and styling files much more streamlined. Removing redundancies provide a more accessible and concise code if another developer were to edit the project.
